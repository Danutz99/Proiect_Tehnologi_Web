# Student notes app

Web app for taking notes during courses/labs

# Goal

To develop a web app that allows students to take notes during courses/labs

# Description

The application must allow students to organise their notes by classes they attend and individual study activities.

The platform is based on a [Single Page Application architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application). It will be accessible on a desktop, mobile or tablet browser (depending on user preferences).
[More about SPA arhitecture](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-a-single-page-application)

The note editor should be easy to use so that the student can take notes during the class. It will implement a markdown sistem to allow simple text formatting.

# Minimal functionalities


- [x] As a student I want to be able to login with my institutional account (@stud.ase.ro) to manage my notes.


- [x] As a student I want to be able to view, add, edit and delete notes so that I can better organize information

- [ ] As a student I want the option to add attachments (images, documents) to the notes I take so that I can have more details about the subject

- [x] As a student I want to be able to organize notes based on classes, date, labels (tags) and keywords so that I can retrieve information easily 

- [ ] As a student I want to be able to share notes with other colleagues 

- [ ] As a student I want to be able to integrate content from other sources and take notes (like for example while I listen to a youtube video, i read a book on kindle, attending an online conference)

- [ ] As a student I want to be able to organize a study group. I can invite multiple colleagues that will share notes within the group
